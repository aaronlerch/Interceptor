// Backpressure-safe writes for raw Bun sockets (unix + TCP).
//
// Bun's socket.write() buffers nothing: it returns how many bytes the kernel
// accepted and silently keeps the rest with the caller. On macOS the unix
// stream send buffer is 8 KiB (net.local.stream.sendspace), so any frame
// bigger than that partially writes even on an idle socket. A dropped tail
// desyncs length-prefixed framing on the receiver and eats every subsequent
// message on the connection (issue #229). Every raw-socket writer in the daemon
// must route through socketWriteAll and flush from its drain handler.
//
// The queue is keyed by socket object identity — Bun passes the same socket
// object to open/data/drain/close as Bun.connect resolves with (verified on
// Bun 1.3.11).
